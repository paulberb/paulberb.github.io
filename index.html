                This isn't your grandma's fun club. It's mine. I mean ours. I thought that would be clear by now? At any rate, please note that this Fun Club will not be at the usual time or location. With that business out of the way, on to pleasure!

                <p>
                    The human form, it's the best right? Each of us is different, all are special and many are beautiful. Join us at <a target=“_blank” href="https://www.fivenightclubmadison.com">Five Nightclub</a> for a celebration of eyeballs, butts, and everything in between. Even that useless old tailbone! TFC's very own Danger Noodle (the lovely and talented Alexx) will be strutting their stuff. The stuff! The strutting! You just can't miss this one folks.

                   We have obtained a copy of Sushi Go Party! Now you and up to seven of your Thursday friends can play at the same time, shuffling sashimi, moving maki, tempting fate with tempura, cheating with chopsticks (don't do that), and piling up that sweet, sweet pudding.

                    Have you ever had that gummy sushi? Or wait, they didn't make that, it was a gummy hamburger and fries. The fries were sour and coated in sugar. They also make a gummy pizza set. Sometimes I miss gummy things.

                   Springtime is quickly melting by, and the mind drifts to thoughts of ice cream. What's your favorite ice cream? Spumone? Huh, cool. Did you have an ice cream shop in your neighborhood when you were little? We had Frosty Freeze in Janesville and we loved it. I would order a hot-fudge shake and I felt cool because it was unconventional, and also because of the ice cream I was eating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'll provide some pints of vegan ice cream, and also feel free to bring your favorite flavor if you feel like it.

                   What comes to mind when you think of Fun Club? Truffle oil chips? Tumple? Gales of laughter? Cans of beer with colorful labels? Or is it the people? Or is it just one person? That would be weird if it were just one person. However, just one person is who we're celebrating this week, with Leona Day! Leona "Leo" Bergmann, bearer of smiles, bringer of mead, and even sweeter still. Damn that's poetic. Whether it's her fiercely competitive nature, unwavering eye contact, or her deep well of compassion and empathy, we all have something to love. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we're all just barely worthy of Peach, then it's just a sliver of a knifes edge of worthiness that brings Leona into our lives approximately once a week. Join us as we curse god above for only making one of her.

                We take care of our own, whether the creature is 1, 3, or 4 legged. Peach has a bent paw, so gather around her hospital bed and offer thrumming prayers with your fellow Thufuclubians. She'll get through this, and we'll emerge on the other side closer, kinder, stronger, and with straight paws all. Praise be to Bast and don't forget to bring your favorite catnip-infused prayer beads.

                Liam also has a show at 8 over at Communication on Milwaukee St, tickets are $8 and I figure we'll play it by ear if people want to go.

                When god invented cats, he didn't know it would be 2000 years until they reached their true potential. God is now dead, but Peach lives, and will have done so for one year as of March 7th. Jo and I don't deserve to have such a wonderful animal in our lives, but we come the closest and bear our wonderful burden with humility and purpose.
            </p>

                What do you get the cat who has everything? Just your smiling faces and petting hands, so come on over and celebrate with us.
