                We take care of our own, whether the creature is 1, 3, or 4 legged. Peach has a bent paw, so gather around her hospital bed and offer thrumming prayers with your fellow Thufuclubians. She'll get through this, and we'll emerge on the other side closer, kinder, stronger, and with straight paws all. Praise be to Bast. 
            </p>

                Bring your favorite catnip-infused prayer beads.

                When god invented cats, he didn't know it would be 2000 years until they reached their true potential. God is now dead, but Peach lives, and will have done so for one year as of March 7th. Jo and I don't deserve to have such a wonderful animal in our lives, but we come the closest and bear our wonderful burden with humility and purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
                What do you get the cat who has everything? Just your smiling faces and petting hands, so come on over and celebrate with us.
            </p>
            <p>*Each guest must bring one set of petting hands to present before Peach.*</p>
