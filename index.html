                Modern dentistry, let me count the ways. For starters, our faces would be 25% less handsome without it. It lets us chew hard candy if we're in a hurry. Pearly whites would be called citrine yellows. Really, I think we all owe a deep debt of gratitude to the practitioners of this sacred discipline.

                Jamie Schiffer is one such enamel artist, and I'm pretty sure she just graduated! Join us for an evening of celebration on the cusp of summer, while we bond together to crown Jamie a dentist. Don't let our friendships decay, or there may arise a cavity in your soul. Please remember to text me so I can let you incisor. Malocclusion.

                None of us have known a Mosesless Madison, and you may feel a pinprick of fear. What if he was holding off an otherworldy menace at great personal cost? Who's going to be Tom Waites? Who can I smoke weed with now? Find the answers to these questions and more at this very special Fun Club. Whether you've known him your entire life or it only feels that way, we'll all be left with gaping holes once Moses leaves on that jet plane. I wish we had a big blanket that we could all hold and he'd be in the middle and then we snap it tight and launch him into the air, over and over.

                There's nothing like biting into a sugar cookie with that bright, colorful icing on top. You feel your incisors glide through the soft, sweet gel until they bump into something a little denser. The cookie itself. With a little bit of force you wrest the yummy chunk from the cookie at large. You chew, blending the pastel paste into the beige meat of the cake. Wash it down with a swig of your favorite milk and feel all your cares fade away. 
                </p>

                Winnie lamented the fact that we missed Easter and wanted to make some cookies. Join us for that, and feel free to bring your favorite frostings or jimmies (that's sprinkles for us yanks). Just nobody bring those tiny, hard silver balls. They taste amazing but they're too hard to crunch and they will ruin the cookie.

                   Springtime is quickly melting by, and the mind drifts to thoughts of ice cream. What's your favorite ice cream? Spumone? Huh, cool. Did you have an ice cream shop in your neighborhood when you were little? We had Frosty Freeze in Janesville and we loved it. I would order a hot-fudge shake and I felt cool because it was unconventional, and also because of the ice cream I was eating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'll provide some pints of vegan ice cream, and also feel free to bring your favorite flavor if you feel like it.

That would be weird if it were just one person. However, just one person is who we're celebrating this week, with Leona Day! Leona "Leo" Bergmann, bearer of smiles, bringer of mead, and even sweeter still. Damn that's poetic. Whether it's her fiercely competitive nature, unwavering eye contact, or her deep well of compassion and empathy, we all have something to love.

She'll get through this, and we'll emerge on the other side closer, kinder, stronger, and with straight paws all. Praise be to Bast and don't forget to bring your favorite catnip-infused prayer beads.

                Liam also has a show at 8 over at Communication on Milwaukee St, tickets are $8 and I figure we'll play it by ear if people want to go.

                When god invented cats, he didn't know it would be 2000 years until they reached their true potential. God is now dead, but Peach lives, and will have done so for one year as of March 7th. Jo and I don't deserve to have such a wonderful animal in our lives, but we come the closest and bear our wonderful burden with humility and purpose.

                What do you get the cat who has everything? Just your smiling faces and petting hands, so come on over and celebrate with us.

            <p>*Each guest must bring one set of petting hands to present before Peach.*</p>
