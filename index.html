                <p>If life was already out of balance in 1982 then I can only shudder in horror at how out of balance it is now, almost 4 decades later. For this week we'll be screening the film KOYAANISQATSI, more relevant with each passing moment.
                </p>
                <p>We'll be skipping both POWAQQATSI and NAGOYQATSI because they're sort of rubbish.

                <p>Remober remober, the 3rd of October. Here we are at last, snuggled up next to a large beige pile of Autumn while a cool wind flows past us, a preview of the icy death-months to come. It'll hurt to be outside soon, so let's soak up the last latent heat of 2019. Jesus what a decade this one was.
                </p>
                <p>I purchased a pair of glow in the dark frisbee, one red and one blue. I only believe in coincidence, so pick whichever color you please. Hold a can of beer in one hand, and with the other huck the disc in my direction. Take a sip, repeat.

                <p>It's Halloween time again and I've already eaten too many candy corns. I like to dig through the jar and take just the pumpkins, because they're the juiciest ones. Sometimes I take a pile with me when I go to bed for a little good-night treat. Speaking of pumpkins, let's segue into the topic of jack-o-lanterns. We've got tools and a book of patterns, you just provide your pumpkin. It's a BYOP situation. Or bring cash or venmo and Jo or I will run over to Festival and grab a few, in case you're walking over and don't want to tote that gourd. Are pumpkins gourds? They must be.

                 <br>Sauté Pan Lid to Sink</h2>

                <p>Late last night I was doing the dishes and I placed the lid of a sauté pan upside down into the sudsy water. Sudsy. Anyway, the lid has a small hole in it, for steam to escape probably. But what to my wondering eyes did appear, but a tiny water fountain erupting from the hole as the soapy water rushed in. I was bewitched, and I wondered how long it would take for the water to fill the lid and for the lid to capsize. The results may surprise you. They certainly surprised me. For this week's main event we'll all crowd into the kitchen and place bets on how long it takes for the lid to sink. I'll refrain from weighing in because, while I didn't record the elapsed time last night, I do have a vague sense of how long it takes. Whomstever comes closest will win a prize!

                <p>We never got around to Skulls the other night, too many juicy distractions. Let's take another run at that at this week's Fun Club. I also have another game to share, where you play as a mischievous goose who waddles around fucking with people. People such as gardener, shopkeeper, little boy. It's cute and fun. You can honk infinite times.  
                </p>
                <p>If you could play as any animal in a video game, which would you choose? Think about your answer and tell somebody. I think it would be fun to be a bear w/cubs, and you have to catch fish and bust up stumps for termites. I also just thought it would be fun and sophisticated to pronounce termites as "ter-ME-tez", so there's that.

                <p>This week we'll be participating in a tube hole, which is usually a bad idea that causes division among friends. I'm being dramatic, of course. The last two tube holes I went to were with a-holes, so I'm not too worried about it this time. You, however, *should* be worried. Worried about which of your fabulous favorite YouTube videos you'd like to share! Put together your most hopeful of hopefuls and send them over to me and I'll put them in a playlist for us. Email's probably the best but I don't care, just get me those sweet sweet URLS. Earls, we call them. paulberb@gmail.com

                <p>Heat and light radiate from the stark white sky, rendering your surroundings a blinding monochrome. Mouth juiceless, you find yourself yearning for a certain cold, tart, neon treat. Sorbet. It's good, you haven't had it in a long while, and you need it. Come to my house and eat it. Maybe bring your favorite one if you have one too.
                </p>
                <p>Last week I was feeling poetic and it really gave folks a spark of inspiration, so I tried to do it again but I ran out of steam. Robert Frosty cold sorbet.

Bathe yourself in the sweat-soaked catharsis of today, knowing full well that winter's dull bounty is already gathering along the periphery. Side by side we gaze longingly into the vibrant green water of the lakes, while all-too-obvious metaphors dance within our heads. Holding hands, we slip beneath the gentle waves one last time.

                <p>It's the dog days of Summer and the only thing to do is chill, so why not join this cool party? The hotter it gets outside, the more we run the AC, and the hotter it gets outside. Chilling.
                </p>
                <p>I ask you, however, what are the alternatives? A while back I saw one and it wasn't pretty. I had a ton of people over to my old apartment that didn't have adequate A/C and we played Johan Sebastian Joust. A humid mess occurred, resulting in a thick veneer of human breath-waste that coated the room, including the ceiling, which began to drip upon us in a concerning and non refreshing manner. Human rain. I made human rain in my house and I vowed to never let it happen again.
                </p>
                <p> The thermostat will be locked down at a bracing 71°, Winnie is making Big Mac Salad, and we'll witness the return of the classic party game called Johan Sebastian Joust. Bring cool treats and wear summer clothes! I don't know why you wouldn't already be in summer clothes!

                </p>
                <p>Ride the ferris wheel, eat some (more) corn, drink a beer and dance the night away. Then do it the next night, and the next, and the next! Drink water in between Fete-ings, and wear sunblock too. The highlight for me and Johanna is the Musique Electronique (ooh lah lah) on Friday and Saturday nights so maybe we'll see you and we can sweat in a tent together.

Some possible activities to do at home by yourself are: sitting on the couch, sitting on the porch, hugging your cat, doing laundry, washing that man right outa your hair, reading the paper, burning some incense while doing a deep hydration face mask, or throwing out old socks. Whatever you decide to do, you deserve it, you're good enough, you're smart enough, and doggone it, people like you. </p>

                It's too nice to sit inside and play games! So let's head to the park for a little picnic outdoorsy time. 
                </p>

                We'll meet up at my place and once we've achieved critical mass we'll gently amble over to the park, which is nearby. Bring a snack, food, alchohol and/or an outdoor game if you have it. Someday soon we'll be drowning in humidity and mosquitos so don't miss your chance!

                Sometimes the chickens come home to roost. Sometimes the chicken in question is one Eleanor Inman, a supremely beautiful human being whom I am pleased to call my friend. And she could become your friend too, on this very special Wednesday edition of ThuFuClu.
                </p>
                <p>
                She's blowing in from the windy city for one night only and requested that I throw her a game night, hence the adjustment from our normal day of the week. I realize that Thursday uniquely works for a lot of people, so if you can't make it I understand. That being said this is certain to be a classic slice of Fun Club goodness and I know you won't regret stopping by, even for just a little while.
                </p>
                <p>
                If you can't make it on Wednesday, don't fret! We'll have a regular ass TFC on Thursday as well. I just can't get enough of you people I guess.

                As Paul returns, bindle upon shoulder, from improv camp, let us come together for just a regular fun club.
                </p>
                <p>But what is a regular fun club? It's people and stories. And games. And beer. But this week we're focusing on the stories in our lives, recent, distant, real or imagined. Equip your courage enhancing items, because it's going to get real. Each person will have up to 5 minutes to tell or share a story. Listening is mandatory, speaking is not. Each person will also have a slip of paper with which to asses each story, with points awarded for categories such as entertainment value, personal applicability, and more. It sounds like this could hurt people's feelings but I promise you that won't happen this time.

                <p>What's in store for you? I have no idea, she won't tell me. I'm not sure if she knows either.
Will she cook a curry? Veto Tummple? Just play Minecraft the whole time? No, no, and yes. Have fun, and do or don't do anything I would or wouldn't do.

                Modern dentistry, let me count the ways. For starters, our faces would be 25% less handsome without it. It lets us chew hard candy if we're in a hurry. Pearly whites would be called citrine yellows. Really, I think we all owe a deep debt of gratitude to the practitioners of this sacred discipline.

                <p>
                Jamie Schiffer is one such enamel artist, and I'm pretty sure she just graduated! Join us for an evening of celebration on the cusp of summer, while we bond together to crown Jamie a dentist. Don't let our friendships decay, or there may arise a cavity in your soul. Please remember to text me so I can let you incisor. Malocclusion.

                None of us have known a Mosesless Madison, and you may feel a pinprick of fear. What if he was holding off an otherworldy menace at great personal cost? Who's going to be Tom Waites? Who can I smoke weed with now? Find the answers to these questions and more at this very special Fun Club. Whether you've known him your entire life or it only feels that way, we'll all be left with gaping holes once Moses leaves on that jet plane. I wish we had a big blanket that we could all hold and he'd be in the middle and then we snap it tight and launch him into the air, over and over.

                There's nothing like biting into a sugar cookie with that bright, colorful icing on top. You feel your incisors glide through the soft, sweet gel until they bump into something a little denser. The cookie itself. With a little bit of force you wrest the yummy chunk from the cookie at large. You chew, blending the pastel paste into the beige meat of the cake. Wash it down with a swig of your favorite milk and feel all your cares fade away.

                Winnie lamented the fact that we missed Easter and wanted to make some cookies. Join us for that, and feel free to bring your favorite frostings or jimmies (that's sprinkles for us yanks). Just nobody bring those tiny, hard silver balls. They taste amazing but they're too hard to crunch and they will ruin the cookie.

Join us at <a target=“_blank” href="https://www.fivenightclubmadison.com">Five Nightclub</a> for a celebration of eyeballs, butts, and everything in between. Even that useless old tailbone! TFC's very own Danger Noodle (the lovely and talented Alexx) will be strutting their stuff. The stuff! The strutting! You just can't miss this one folks.

                   We have obtained a copy of Sushi Go Party! Now you and up to seven of your Thursday friends can play at the same time, shuffling sashimi, moving maki, tempting fate with tempura, cheating with chopsticks (don't do that), and piling up that sweet, sweet pudding.

                    Have you ever had that gummy sushi? Or wait, they didn't make that, it was a gummy hamburger and fries. The fries were sour and coated in sugar. They also make a gummy pizza set. Sometimes I miss gummy things.

                   Springtime is quickly melting by, and the mind drifts to thoughts of ice cream. What's your favorite ice cream? Spumone? Huh, cool. Did you have an ice cream shop in your neighborhood when you were little? We had Frosty Freeze in Janesville and we loved it. I would order a hot-fudge shake and I felt cool because it was unconventional, and also because of the ice cream I was eating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'll provide some pints of vegan ice cream, and also feel free to bring your favorite flavor if you feel like it.

                   What comes to mind when you think of Fun Club? Truffle oil chips? Tumple? Gales of laughter? Cans of beer with colorful labels? Or is it the people? Or is it just one person? That would be weird if it were just one person. However, just one person is who we're celebrating this week, with Leona Day! Leona "Leo" Bergmann, bearer of smiles, bringer of mead, and even sweeter still. Damn that's poetic. Whether it's her fiercely competitive nature, unwavering eye contact, or her deep well of compassion and empathy, we all have something to love. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we're all just barely worthy of Peach, then it's just a sliver of a knifes edge of worthiness that brings Leona into our lives approximately once a week. Join us as we curse god above for only making one of her.

                We take care of our own, whether the creature is 1, 3, or 4 legged. Peach has a bent paw, so gather around her hospital bed and offer thrumming prayers with your fellow Thufuclubians. She'll get through this, and we'll emerge on the other side closer, kinder, stronger, and with straight paws all. Praise be to Bast and don't forget to bring your favorite catnip-infused prayer beads.

                Liam also has a show at 8 over at Communication on Milwaukee St, tickets are $8 and I figure we'll play it by ear if people want to go.

                When god invented cats, he didn't know it would be 2000 years until they reached their true potential. God is now dead, but Peach lives, and will have done so for one year as of March 7th. Jo and I don't deserve to have such a wonderful animal in our lives, but we come the closest and bear our wonderful burden with humility and purpose.
            </p>

                What do you get the cat who has everything? Just your smiling faces and petting hands, so come on over and celebrate with us.
