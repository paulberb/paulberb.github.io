I'd encourage each of you to visit <a target="blank" href="https://blaseball.com">blaseball.com</a>, pick a team, and start watching. I'd also not blame any of you if you never did, cause it's A LOT. If you decide to check it out, please feel free to ask me or Niq any questions about it. There's a lot I'm still learning, but I'm pretty well versed in the basics.

                <p>This week we present a special, very raunchy edition of Thursday Fun Club! That's right, it's time for us to read our selections from Literary Review's Worst Sex in Fiction Awards! We'll each do one at a time, in case of duplicate selections. We'll also be starting at 8pm this week. I can't wait to hear your spins on this terrible prose, which may begin to wake us all from our winter-compounded Covid doldrums.
                </p>
                <p>Speaking of which, Winnie, Alexx and myself are set to get the vax sometime next month, events that will shortly be followed by the return of PICNIC WEATHER and TFC PICNICS with all of you! We'll get to sit under the warm sun, drinking cool beverages and looking at each other's real actual faces. Next week marks the one year(!) anniversary of the last Fun Club outing, with Cocks in the Con. The week after that was the two year anniversary of TFC itself, and the last time we were all together inside my house. Oh my god!

                <p>My thanks to everyone for embracing the new TFC format! I think we have a winner, and a means to get us through these last few cold months before we can start picniqing again. If anyone wants to suggest any ice-breakers or activities, don't hesitate!
                </p>
                <p>As a reminder, those who are interested may choose a passage, or a few passages, to read aloud on a future fun club, from lists on <a target="blank" href="https://literaryreview.co.uk/bad-sex-in-fiction-award">this</a> webpage.  You really won't believe how bad some of it is, with all of it's clunky metaphor and cringey depictions of various body parts. Participation is optional of course, and it'll be a couple of weeks before we get to it. But I'm looking forward to it!

                <p>February. The cruelest month, during an already cruel period. But I have the antidote, and you're looking at it! It's the picture of us. Well get ready for an IRL dose because this week it's finally Garage Party time! We've acquired a portable heater, but you'll still probably want to bundle up. Masks will be required in the garage, you may take them off and imbibe outside however. Maybe bring a chair or two as well. I can't wait to see you all in person!

                <p>So there probably won't be a "day" where a switch is flipped and we all line up in my house for the hug guessing game alluded to back in April. Nonetheless, we are getting closer to a time when we can all start getting closer again. It'll probably be me, Alexx and Winnie first, and we hope you'll all enjoy our essential worker parties that we'll make to to livestream. But for that first official Fun Club of the post vax new normal, what should we do? What game should we play first? Should we just huddle together in a blanket fort for 6 hours? And how about the food? Great terrines of JoBiMaSal and crates of peanut butter brownies? A gin fountain? Help!  
                </p>
                <p>And help you shall, should you wish, by following <a target="blank" href="https://forms.gle/aUKBDczXZhg7ESZQA">this </a> link and sharing your thoughts. No multiple choice this time, just give me a little stream of your sweet consciousness and I'll share the results. I'll be looking for insight into how to spend the first hour, what the first meal should be, what background YouTube, and more. Only 4 or 5 more months, probably!

                <p>Phew. We all made it through the year, and I'm so happy and grateful for that. It's really all that matters, as I'm sure you're all aware. While the missed opportunities of this year are tragic, we must remember that we have years and decades ahead of us, filled with parties, hugging, dancing, laughing, singing, and MORE. And within the next 4-6 months we'll maybe start doing some of those things in the same room again! We might sill be wearing masks, we might go light on the hugs, but it's true. It would have been a much bleaker, darker 2020 (really?! how?!) without each other's companionship, encouragement, beautiful faces, loving hearts, and creative minds. The ThuFuClu Crew really came through this year. Thanks everybody.
                </p>
                <p>We've decided to do an evening Zoom this time starting around 8. It probably won't go all the way 'till midnight, but if people want an encore for the e-ball drop we can probably hop back on, or maybe I'll run down the sidewalk at 12:10AM and peek in a window or two. I'd also be up for a post midnight frozen fool walk if anyone else lacks the same judgement as me. But anyway, join us for the usual Zoom fun, and I want to try out some of the new Jackbox games! I remain ever proud of each one of you, and I look forward to much brighter days, and seeing your bright faces. And now, if you'll help me as I lift 2020 right... into... the trash.

                </p>
                <p>Your ghosts are still on the wall, like shadows from a nuclear blast. Standing in a line one year ago, three-quarters boozy confidence, one quarter nerves, about to sing a song that nobody knew. But we belted our hearts out, and I, famously, have never been prouder of you. "La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la...", we began. Johanna is one year more wonderful, so we'll have to work extra hard to overcome the drawbacks of 2020 as we strive to show her how special she is, and how much she means to us all. Come for the Zoom, stay for the BOOM!

                <p>How long have you been out there, persevering, fighting through enemies and obstacles both in and ex ternal, the visible, as well as the intangible. You know, those things that can't be tan-ged. Then, gradually, or perhaps suddenly, you hear it. Or you feel it? The comforting, expanding aura, unmistakable. It's a bonfire. And surrounding it are your friends, your lovers, and your allies. You've managed to return to the glowing coals and glowing faces, feeling slightly more hollow than before, but your mind and spirit intact. You remember that you're you, you're loved, and that you want to keep pushing forward. Even in a broken and grey world, long past the slightest whiff of salvation. I'm glad you're still here.

                <p>I'm gonna be honest, I'm not having a ton of fun updating this website lately. The world changes so much every day, and yet I feel stuck in time. I could preach to the choir about BLM or face coverings or fuck the police, but it would be just that. It was more fun when y'all would come over and there would be a theme, and all the dynamism that would entail. We'll get back to that place, someday. 
                </p>
                <p>For those reasons I am once again asking for your contributions to this website, just in case. A personal story, a poem, a rant, a love letter, whatever you'd like. I'll keep the e-fires burning either way, but do let me know if you'd like to share.

                <p>As we speak Peach rests in a cage inside a dimly lit facility just outside of Verona, an Elizabethan collar around her neck. She went under the knife today (Wednesday) and it was a complete success! The house is extremely quiet without her. Too quiet. But not too quiet in that cool movie way. It's too quiet in a sad movie way. But in 8 short/long weeks she'll be all better and her leg won't come out anymore!

                <p>So this is the first official No Thursday Fun Club in the COVID era. Or you could all picnic or whatever without us! Will it be the same? Are we some special, integral catalyst? Only one way to find out!

For once the summer speeding by is a boon. But we're doing it! We're making it through, alive, healthy-ish, and together.

                <p>In other news, it's time once again for a picnic at Yahara Place Park, brought to you by the kindly and be-bereted folks over at La Kitchenette (The Kitchen). They're doing some sort of soba noodle takeaway thing, and while it doesn't sound very French, it does sound very vegan. They have lots of other tasty choices as well, so order your thing and bring it on down to the water on Thursday. Until then, we'll see you there, and... 
<i>au revoir</i>.

                <p>Thursday Fun Club is a fellowship and weekly gamenight established by Paul Berberich in March of 2018, following a weekday-agnostic pilot program earlier that year. Its chief functions involve cultivating a community of various individuals who come together in the spirit of friendship, play, compassion, and rascallyness.

                <p>While enduring the COVID-19 pandemic TFC transitioned to an online or outdoor only concern, and comes together using the Zoom online videochatting service. Though their bodies remain distant, their hearts are re-melded each week.

                </p>
                <p>Also, I've been thinking about starting to open up to a small circle of people, vis a vis hanging out, going into homes, ect. None of us have gotten the virus (as far as I can tell), meaning that we could have been hanging out with little to no risk. Which is not necessarily an appropriate or wise sentiment, but it's probably true. But then the rest of the country had to blow it by not wearing masks or social distancing and now cases are surging again and I'm (rightfully) concerned once more. So I won't be doing this anytime soon, but maybe think about what it will actually look like when we're able to lower our guards again.

How boring it would be for me to look around the room and see a bunch of other me's, with their red Fred Durst hats tightly clamped upon head and soul patches gleaming, while we listen to Foo Fighters* and watch The Bachelorette, stuffing our faces with Jr. Bacon Chee, talking about fighter jets.

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Next, here are your thoughts for improving the Fun Club:
                    <ul>
                        <li>maybe more kittens? lol!</li>
                        <li>Actually being able to do it in person. (I miss everyone!)</li>
                        <li>Eradicate COVID</li>
                        <li>Right now? Not much! I look forward to seeing all y'all in person again someday.</li>
                        <li>More diverse programming</li>
                        <li>Sing-a-longs</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><img src="/images/chart4.png" width="98%" /></p>
                <p>It was a very close race, but it looks like the next Name Day will be my own. "But Paul," you cry, "Isn't every Fun Club a Paul Day?" Not like this... Not like this... Don't worry though, you all have months and months to memorize the Fun Club Anthem and bone up on your improv games. Johanna has kindly agreed to make that post, when the time comes.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><img src="/images/chart5.png" width="98%" /></p>
                <p>We may now lay this contentious issue to rest. Long live Johanna's Big Mac Salad.

                <br>
                <p><img src="/images/chart6.png" width="98%" /></p>
                <p>Nice representation across the board, and I can say I'm really looking forward to Paul and Alexx' Big Arm Wrestling Match.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Finally, here are your wonderful ideas:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Picnic, bonfire night, murder mystery, another spa day, featured cocktail nights, our own personal pride parade</li>
                        <li>ALL THE PARTIES ALL THE FOOD ALL THE HUGs ALL THE FUN</li>
                        <li>Invention convention, collaborative story writing (Google Docs), origami zoo, tiny campfire (candles/smores/ghost stories)</li>
                        <li>Finger Painting, Octavia Butler's BIrthday</li>
                        <li>Cookies, labo, trampolining, gib’s, escape room</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>And that's it folks! Thanks for participating, and I can't wait until we get to begin putting all of these fun plans into motion. And since I haven't gotten to it yet, BLACK LIVES MATTER and FUCK THE POLICE!</p>

                <p>With the formalities taken care of, let me welcome you to this week's Fun Club. Not much to report this week. I restarted Anathem by Neal Stephenson again, and I think this time it's going to stick. It's quite a wild ride, and I'm practicing being ok with not understanding everything that's going on. Maybe good practice for the real world as well. Peach is learning how to play with hands, which is a ton of fun. She always seems concerned with making sure she's not actually applying any real claw or tooth pressure and I love her little concerned face. She couldn't leave a mark on a human if all of her lives depended on it. She's just Too Sweet.
                </p>
                <p>*UPDATE* Peach is becoming less concerned with claw pressure.

            </div>
                <p>It's a musical blast from my childhood past this week, as we examine a collection of Isao Tomita's most riveting compositions. My parents had the CD and John and I would listen endlessly, the music stirring our imagination and creating a distinctive feelings while we played with our toys. I haven't had a huge appetite for music for the past few months, but this album has rekindled my aural embers. Oh, won't you listen too? 
                </p>
                <p>If you have Spotify it's just a click away. <a target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7yAuhoZXCopPOlaCh21Xlt">This</a> click in fact! If you don't have Spotify, I have ordered some Tomita vinyl, and I don't own a record player. 
                </p>
                <h3>Track Listing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Also sprach Zarathustra: Fanfare</i> - It's when those monkeys were throwing bones at the giant black slab. It's ok.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><i>Grand Canyon Suite: On the Trail</i> - Bump along an echoing canyon with your best friends. Fun! Starts a little scary.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><i>Canon in D Major, P. 37</i> - Take the gentlest of naps.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><i>Syncopated Clock</i> - An all-time favorite. Listen for the stereoscopic "boom boom" at 1:21. I might not know what stereoscopic means.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><i>Boléro</i> - A long, slow burn. A little pilot drives an airplane from one ear to the other for 10 minutes. Great while stoned. (It's all great when stoned)</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><i>Star Wars: Main Title</i> - A true classic, but with a brief gimmicky twist. Good for children.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><i>Suite Bergamasque: Clair de Lune, No. 3</i> - Beautiful, gentle, delicate. A favorite of Leo's.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</i> - The least essential track, not much to grab on to. It's fun and goofy though. It's about aliens.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><i>Symphony No. 5: Allegro marcato</i> - Now we're talking. Wind through the expanding passages of your own mind in this driving, frilly cacophony. Synthetic trumpets tickle your cochlear essence until you climax at exactly 2:40.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><i>Golliwogg's Cakewalk, No. 6</i> - Another favorite of mine. Close your eyes and try to picture the creature Golliwog and what his cakewalk entails. If you're stumped, look up the word "evocative" in the dictionary and he'll be there. Imagine what this song would do to the malleable neural mesh of a young child! You know me, so you don't even have to imagine.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><i>Infernal Dance of King Kastchei</i> - *Try* and survive this boss-fight of a song as lasers sting your brain and flubber fills your guts. Listen for doors opening starting at 1:33. Also, it's the second most badass song title on the album.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><i>Hora Staccato</i> - Before portraying Aaron Neville on SNL, this song played on this album. It's jaunty but not that great. If you skip it that's fine.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><i>Mars, The Bringer of War</i> - Not for the faint of heart, this track drips menace from every lashing sonic tentacle. Steely buzzsaws of malice karom through your skull as the track mounts to it's devastating conclusion: John and I's favorite toys being shot through and torn apart by crackling space-lasers, over. And over. And over. Until they are killed...(or are they?) Pay special attention to the coded conversation at 3:40. Can you make out what they're saying?</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><i>The Great Gate of Kiev</i> - How do you put a capper on all of that? Why, with my favorite track on the album, and incidentally the most badassedly titled one too. This is the track that brought me back to life, and if you only listen to one song on the album (and I pray that you don't) then let it be this one. As the song opens, our toys descended from the heavens, newly resurrected. I'll let the rest speak for itself.</li>
                    <br>

                <p>Thought patterns slowly adjust as our cruel summer begins to take shape. With uncertainty shadowing each step forward, a sometimes not-so-subtle psychic weight has descended upon our minds. Will we make a better world on the other side of this? Is there even an "other side" to reach for? Will our species simply try and forget COVID-19 and all of the lessons it provided, and strive to return to a world of mental slavery and ecological ruin? (yes) 
                </p>
                <p>I hope everyone is holding up well. Jo and I are fine, and I'm glad that none of us here in Wisconsin have gotten ill. My little brother lives out in Boulder and works at a grocery store, and seems to be enduring a second round of illness in a month. There's no way to know for sure (because people can't get FUCKING TESTED) but it seems like it's the 'vid. He's doing better day over day, but it's still quite a worrisome situation. Keep him in your thoughts.

            <div class="author-text">

            </div>
                <p>I think when this is all over we should try a blind hug test. One person is the ringleader, everyone else is blindfolded and lined up. A tone is emitted, everyone takes one step forward and into the arms of someone else. A second tone is emitted after a few moments and everyone simultaneously releases their grip, takes a step back, and begins to concentrate. At this point many clues are rumbling through our oxytocin addled heads, leading to questions such as: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Was I just enveloped by a gentle tallness?</li>
                        <li>Did I experience the compensatory movements of someone ceaselessly wiggling their tushie?</li>
                        <li>Was it simply a long, sweet hug?</li>
                        <li>Was that a scrap of beard in mine ear as we drew close?</li>
                        <li>During this hug, did I hear the unmistakable creak of a leather jacket being gingerly constricted by mine very own arms?</li>
                        <li>Did I smell Jo's intoxicating perfume, and am I Paul right now?</li>
                        <li>Was it Winnie?</li>
                        <li>Is anyone else here? Hello?! Rodger?</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Once the votes have been tallied we'll see who the best hugger is (it's Alexx) and who the best hug identifier is (TBD).
                </p>
                <p>I haven't cried about all of this yet, and I hope I do soon, cause I love crying and I feel a big cry stuck in my chest that I want to get out. Hasn't happened so far, but I know I'm gonna cry when I get to hug you guys again.
                </p>
                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you could hug anyone from the past, who would it be?</li>
                    <li>Were ancient hugs the same as modern hugs?</li>
                    <li>If your arms are in casts, what is the next best thing?</li>

                    <br>
                    O the days gone by! O the days gone by!<br>
The apples in the orchard, and the pathway through the rye;<br>
The chirrup of the robin, and the whistle of the quail<br>
As he piped across the meadows sweet as any nightingale;<br>
When the bloom was on the clover, and the blue was in the sky,<br>
And my happy heart brimmed over in the days gone by.<br>
<br>
In the days gone by, when my naked feet were tripped<br>
By the honey-suckle’s tangles where the water-lilies dipped,<br>
And the ripples of the river lipped the moss along the brink<br>
Where the placid-eyed and lazy-footed cattle came to drink,<br>
And the tilting snipe stood fearless of the truant’s wayward cry<br>
And the splashing of the swimmer, in the days gone by.<br>
<br>
O the days gone by! O the days gone by!<br>
The music of the laughing lip, the luster of the eye;<br>
The childish faith in fairies, and Aladdin’s magic ring—<br>
The simple, soul-reposing, glad belief in everything,—<br>
When life was like a story, holding neither sob nor sigh,<br>
In the golden olden glory of the days gone by.<br>

                <p>I don't know about you, but I don't feel as though the staggering reality of this situation has truly hit me yet. I think a little bit seeps in each day, and a little more each week, when I don't get to see you all. Think about it... what if some dude had come along and stopped Fun Club for 3 months? There would be an outcry, anger, retribution. Justice. But, since it's a pandemic that came on slowly, then all at once, it feels different. Numb, and unreal. Nothing feels as real to me anymore, I suppose in part because the facade of society is crumbling before our eyes. I think all of us have also gained some clarity when it comes to what is truly important in life. 
                </p>
                <p>While the boardgames gather dust and the polaroid film remains sealed, we can still grasp at some fellowship here. If anyone has thoughts to share, just email me and I'll add them to the site. I also want to plan some porch parties once the air is a little less chilly. Goddamn it you guys. This really stinks.

                <p>The world reels as the pandemic takes hold. It got Tom Hanks and basketball last week, next week the Olympics and elections? Yes, it's now more important than ever to keep our wits about us, practice good personal hygiene, and sadly, avoid grouping together in a squishy pile of love in my living room. With community spread established in Madison it's the only prudent choice to make. I'd also like to set an example, and err on the side of caution. But I miss you all.

                <p>In lighter news, Animal Crossing: New Horizons comes out today! Johanna and I are beyond excited for this, and we're looking forward to creating a new island town together. There's space for a few of you to move in as well, and we can't wait to share the game with you once this C-virus business is in the rearview.

                <p>Due to my rising concern regarding COVID-19 I have decided to cancel this week's fun club. I'm not one to panic or be consumed by what-ifs, but I'd like to wait and see what the coming weeks look like before I fill my apartment with love, laughter and possibly disease. In my opinion, it's starting to look like social distancing may be the smart thing to do, and we'll be playing it by ear as time goes on. I just want everyone to stay healthy and safe. I've been watching this English nurse's Youtube channel, and he posts daily updates, as well as more general info about personal hygiene and the like. Take it with as many grains of salt as you like, but he refers only to governmental reports and medical journals in his videos, and I'd highly recommend you <a target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Campbellteaching">take a look</a> and stay informed.
                </p>
                <p>This doesn't feel like the time for my usual brand of quips, so I leave you with this:
                </p>
                <p><i>In this respect, our townsfolk were like everybody else, wrapped up in themselves; in other words, they were humanists: they disbelieved in pestilences. A pestilence isn't a thing made to man's measure; therefore we tell ourselves that pestilence is a mere bogy of the mind, a bad dream that will pass away. But it doesn't always pass away and, from one bad dream to another, it is men who pass away, and the humanists first of all, because they have taken no precautions.
                </p>
                <p>Our townsfolk were not more to blame than others; they forgot to be modest, that
was all, and thought that everything still was possible for them; which presupposed that pestilences were impossible. They went on doing business, arranged for journeys, and formed views. How should they have given a thought to anything like plague, which rules out any future, cancels journeys, silences the exchange of views. They fancied themselves free, and no one will ever be free so long as there are pestilences.</i>

                <p>The very first *Tues*day Fun Club was way back in 2014, approx. 1.5 lifetimes ago. It was created by myself and two former friends, as something for us roller derby widows to do while our S.O.'s practiced each Tuesday evening. While I look back on this first iteration with feelings slightly north of ambivalence, and while I felt like I never truly fit in with that group, I am grateful for those people and those experiences. They helped shape who I am now, someone less prone to compromise what I desire out of my friendships, and someone empowered to make the things I want to happen, happen. Happen.
                </p>
                <p>The very first *Thurs*day Fun Club was held two March's ago, and I'm so happy that people want to come to my house once a week. It means a lot to Jo and I. Truly, I like nothing more than to fill my life with, well, laughter and love, and you all are the filling-uppingest folks that I know. Here's to many more years of ThuFuClu goodness.

                <p>It's almost time to bid farewell to old man winter, and thank god for that. Before we do, however, we have another entry in the Winter Doldrums notebook to attend to. While it may sound like what you'd do in Clue Manor if you weren't feeling murdery or detectivey, it in fact is some sort of thing where we drink fancy drinks at Olbrich! It's eight dollars.

                <p>In other events, it turns out that KOYAANISQATSI was the movie we deserved, but not the one we needed right now. We didn't watch it. Everyone was so happy that night and I didn't want to bring the room down, as only Phillip Glass set to images of a landfill can. We'll do it another time, preferably when we need it, but don't deserve it.

Thursday Fun Club: The Next Generation was held on March 1st, 2018, and look at us now. What a beautiful little community we've become, cultivated via my keen, judicious shears and Johanna's potent, metaphorical fertilizer. We'll have a special 2 year anniversary event next week, so start thinking of your favorite TFC mems and memes.

                <p>I love films, and it's time once again to look to the silver screen as we present a showing of Godfrey Reggio's <i>KOYAANISQATSI</i>. If life was already out of balance* in 1982 then I can only shudder at the state of affairs now, almost 4 decades later. This film seems more relevant with each passing year, and if you haven't heard of it you may watch a trailer <a target="_blank"href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PirH8PADDgQ">here.</a>
                </p>
                <p>We'll be skipping both sequels (POWAQQATSI and NAGOYQATSI) because they're sort of rubbish.  And now our report from last week's Niq Day:

                <p>With these gifts in mind we'll raise a glass, listen to a tune or two, and whatever else Niq may fancy. I for one am very happy that this person is in our lives, and talking with them about music, gaming, distopias, machines, apocalypses, and the beautiful nature of life's simple pleasures will always lift my spirits. Niq, this one's for you!

                <p>With the unbridled success of Spa Day gently tumbling through our subconsciouses, we're all a little too relaxed for a Fun Club this week. If you weren't lucky enough to make it last time, let me tell you: we made good on the premise. In just one glance I beheld Jo doing her nails, Erica getting her nails did (courtesy of Leo) and Winnie soaking her little tootsies in the tub of hot water. Niq was across from me, but they had a nose strip on as well. I did a nose strip too, and I'd rather forget about what I saw upon removal, forever. And don't forget the ecstacy of the hand rub trades. Y'know, I think hand massages are really underrated.
                </p>
                <p>Truth be told, the real reason we're not doing a Fun Club is because tomorrow is Niq and Alexx's Rock Star Party! Calling all Bowies, Joplins and Waits! Put on your best outfit, cause there's usually a costume contest! If you're a ThuFuClu'r and you want to come, but need the deets, just hit me up!

                <p>With the colossal failure of the Roomba Wager hanging fresh in the air, the already damp spirits of those who dwell within TFC Towers are dampened further. You miss 100% of the shots you don't make, but sometimes you gotta know when to cut your losses and reign in your fanciful ideas. With that in mind, we've got a way for us to collectively lick our spiritual wounds: Spa Day!
                </p>
                <p>Come over for the full spa experience, including:

                <p>With the holidays in the rearview, Moses secreted back to Long Beach and Johanna safe from the clutches of NYC, a sense of a semblance of normalcy settles across the fun club, much like a gentle blanket of fresh snow. Contentedly relaxing under blankets, our little hearts begin to beat out the rhythm of a new decade. There's so much potential to make the world, and each other's lives, BETTER. Our little hearts pittering, and our big ol' brains begin to wonder: How do we wait out these winter doldrums? With fellowship, snacks, beer, ganja, and TFC's Second Ever Wager!
                </p>
                <p>Wager how long the Roomba takes to dock! Wager how long the Roomba takes to dock! Sometimes it gets it right away, sometimes it wanders like a drunk for 4 minutes. Get your bets in, press the button, and cheer as the little vacuum that might bumps into it's dock 3 times, spins around, and goes in the other room for a while. Thrilling, thrilling stuff, people.

                <p>Don't worry though, all of the regular ThuFuClu goodness will be in effect as well. What's a thing we could do that Johanna doesn't normally want to do? Play Johan Sebastian Joust? Probably not. But we should.

                <p>Johanna Cherry. Friend to animals, compassionate, thoughtful. Smart. Cute. Others. I like watching her when she talks to anyone at all, friend or stranger, because she always seems engaged and genuine, her face bright and warm. She inspires me, like Helen Hunt inspired Jack Nicholson in As Good as it Gets. So it's her birthday on Christmas eve, just like that little old baby Jesus. C'mon over to our manger, lay down your sweet head, and look up to the stars as they look down where you lay. We're going to make Birthmas cookies, even though Birthmas is the most disgusting portmanteau I've ever come up with.

                <p>I had a couple friends over to watch the new episode of Rick and Morty last night, and we all sat on the couch. Let me tell you, it just feels less claustrophobic and more gentle and free in here now. You can sit on the couch and look into the kitchen and it seems so big and far away, and you just melt into your seat in contentment. So c'mon over for that regular old Fun Club flavor, wrapped up in shiny new packaging with a bow on top. Christmas.

Fuck I used to love Runts. I mean Nerds! Nerds. Runts are OK, but no banana pls. I used to eat Nerds Ropes and they made my face hot) and in the mean time we've got something special for you.

Miles has clued us in on their event, conveniently happening this Thursday at <a target="blank"href="https://www.cruciblemadison.com/">Crucible</a> nightclub.

                <p>This is it, folks. The last Thursday Fun Club...  
                </p>
                <p>At least, it's the last one on Livingston St. We've got the bottom floor of a house with our names on it and will be moving at the end of the month, and we're pretty excited. But we'd be remiss if we didn't look back and appreciate all of the fun that we had here, and the amenities that won't be coming with us. Including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>4 Season Catio</li>
                    <li>1 Season Rooftop</li>
                    <li>10 people jammed into a tiny living room, elbow to elbow on the couch</li>
                    <li>Trains, Trains, and Automo-trains</li>
                    <li>Killer Queen within shouting distance</li>
                    <li>Loud, loud central air</li>
                    <li>No room for Johann Sebastian Joust</li>
                </ul>
                <p>So join us, won't you, for the un-christening of good old our-apartment. And then, on to bigger and better things. Or at least maintain the same baseline level of fun, or at the very least slow down the declining levels of fun. Or just survive. As long as we have each other, the end of the world can be, well, fun.

                <p>It's almost the most wonderful time... of the year. Just under 6 weeks, according to ye olde Christmas Countdown. Until then, things are HEATING up with the maiden voyage of the WINTER JACKBOX TOURNAMENT. Each week we'll knock out another chapter or so from the Jackbox archives, with points awarded to first, second and third place. I'm thinking 5 pts, 3 pts, and 1 pt respectively. This will culminate with the Grand Finals as we play the newly released Jackbox VI. I smell a prize for the winner, and I'm not talking Christmas roast! More like the new plastic smell of a small denomination gift card from one of our neighborhoods fine small businesses. Or IS it a roast?
                </p>
                <p>Winter in Wisconsin is deadly and occasionally depressing, so come, warm your hearts, minds, and bodies at my house. We're moving soon so this may be one of your last chances to see a train go by real close, admire the frozen catio, or take to the rooftops for a teeth-chattering selfie. Don't worry, we're not going very far.

                <p>It's Halloween time again and I've already eaten too many candy corns. I like to dig through the jar and take just the pumpkins, because they're the juiciest ones. Sometimes I take a pile with me when I go to bed for a little good-night treat. Speaking of pumpkins, let's segue into the topic of jack-o-lanterns. We've got tools and a book of patterns, you just provide your pumpkin. It's a BYOP situation. Or bring cash or venmo and Jo or I will run over to Festival and grab a few, in case you're walking over and don't want to tote that gourd. Are pumpkins gourds? They must be.

                 <br>Sauté Pan Lid to Sink</h2>

                <p>Late last night I was doing the dishes and I placed the lid of a sauté pan upside down into the sudsy water. Sudsy. Anyway, the lid has a small hole in it, for steam to escape probably. But what to my wondering eyes did appear, but a tiny water fountain erupting from the hole as the soapy water rushed in. I was bewitched, and I wondered how long it would take for the water to fill the lid and for the lid to capsize. The results may surprise you. They certainly surprised me. For this week's main event we'll all crowd into the kitchen and place bets on how long it takes for the lid to sink. I'll refrain from weighing in because, while I didn't record the elapsed time last night, I do have a vague sense of how long it takes. Whomstever comes closest will win a prize!

I also have another game to share, where you play as a mischievous goose who waddles around fucking with people. People such as gardener, shopkeeper, little boy. It's cute and fun. You can honk infinite times.  
                </p>
                <p>If you could play as any animal in a video game, which would you choose? Think about your answer and tell somebody. I think it would be fun to be a bear w/cubs, and you have to catch fish and bust up stumps for termites. I also just thought it would be fun and sophisticated to pronounce termites as "ter-ME-tez", so there's that.

                </p>
                <p>This week we'll be participating in a tube hole, which is usually a bad idea that causes division among friends. I'm being dramatic, of course. The last two tube holes I went to were with a-holes, so I'm not too worried about it this time. You, however, *should* be worried. Worried about which of your fabulous favorite YouTube videos you'd like to share! Put together your most hopeful of hopefuls and send them over to me and I'll put them in a playlist for us. Email's probably the best but I don't care, just get me those sweet sweet URLS. Earls, we call them. paulberb@gmail.com

Mouth juiceless, you find yourself yearning for a certain cold, tart, neon treat. Sorbet. It's good, you haven't had it in a long while, and you need it. Come to my house and eat it. Maybe bring your favorite one if you have one too.
                </p>
                <p>Last week I was feeling poetic and it really gave folks a spark of inspiration, so I tried to do it again but I ran out of steam. Robert Frosty cold sorbet.

Bathe yourself in the sweat-soaked catharsis of today, knowing full well that winter's dull bounty is already gathering along the periphery. Side by side we gaze longingly into the vibrant green water of the lakes, while all-too-obvious metaphors dance within our heads. Holding hands, we slip beneath the gentle waves one last time.

                <p>It's the dog days of Summer and the only thing to do is chill, so why not join this cool party? The hotter it gets outside, the more we run the AC, and the hotter it gets outside. Chilling.
                </p>
                <p>I ask you, however, what are the alternatives? A while back I saw one and it wasn't pretty. I had a ton of people over to my old apartment that didn't have adequate A/C and we played Johan Sebastian Joust. A humid mess occurred, resulting in a thick veneer of human breath-waste that coated the room, including the ceiling, which began to drip upon us in a concerning and non refreshing manner. Human rain. I made human rain in my house and I vowed to never let it happen again.
                </p>
                <p> The thermostat will be locked down at a bracing 71°, Winnie is making Big Mac Salad, and we'll witness the return of the classic party game called Johan Sebastian Joust. Bring cool treats and wear summer clothes! I don't know why you wouldn't already be in summer clothes!

Drink water in between Fete-ings, and wear sunblock too. The highlight for me and Johanna is the Musique Electronique (ooh lah lah) on Friday and Saturday nights so maybe we'll see you and we can sweat in a tent together.

Some possible activities to do at home by yourself are: sitting on the couch, sitting on the porch, hugging your cat, doing laundry, washing that man right outa your hair, reading the paper, burning some incense while doing a deep hydration face mask, or throwing out old socks. Whatever you decide to do, you deserve it, you're good enough, you're smart enough, and doggone it, people like you. </p>

                It's the last day of Spring everyone! I believe it was Lord Tennyson who said "In the Spring a young (person's) fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love", so it's your last chance for that Spring fling you've always been talking about. 
                </p>
                <p>
                What does this mean for Fun Club? Hopefully nothing, it's not that kind of club.

                We'll meet up at my place and once we've achieved critical mass we'll gently amble over to the park, which is nearby. Bring a snack, food, alchohol and/or an outdoor game if you have it. Someday soon we'll be drowning in humidity and mosquitos so don't miss your chance!

                Sometimes the chickens come home to roost. Sometimes the chicken in question is one Eleanor Inman, a supremely beautiful human being whom I am pleased to call my friend. And she could become your friend too, on this very special Wednesday edition of ThuFuClu.
                </p>
                <p>
                She's blowing in from the windy city for one night only and requested that I throw her a game night, hence the adjustment from our normal day of the week. I realize that Thursday uniquely works for a lot of people, so if you can't make it I understand. That being said this is certain to be a classic slice of Fun Club goodness and I know you won't regret stopping by, even for just a little while.
                </p>
                <p>
                If you can't make it on Wednesday, don't fret! We'll have a regular ass TFC on Thursday as well. I just can't get enough of you people I guess.

                As Paul returns, bindle upon shoulder, from improv camp, let us come together for just a regular fun club.
                </p>
                <p>But what is a regular fun club? It's people and stories. And games. And beer. But this week we're focusing on the stories in our lives, recent, distant, real or imagined. Equip your courage enhancing items, because it's going to get real. Each person will have up to 5 minutes to tell or share a story. Listening is mandatory, speaking is not. Each person will also have a slip of paper with which to asses each story, with points awarded for categories such as entertainment value, personal applicability, and more. It sounds like this could hurt people's feelings but I promise you that won't happen this time.

                <p>What's in store for you? I have no idea, she won't tell me. I'm not sure if she knows either.
Will she cook a curry? Veto Tummple? Just play Minecraft the whole time? No, no, and yes. Have fun, and do or don't do anything I would or wouldn't do.

                Modern dentistry, let me count the ways. For starters, our faces would be 25% less handsome without it. It lets us chew hard candy if we're in a hurry. Pearly whites would be called citrine yellows. Really, I think we all owe a deep debt of gratitude to the practitioners of this sacred discipline.
                </p>
                <p>
                Jamie Schiffer is one such enamel artist, and I'm pretty sure she just graduated! Join us for an evening of celebration on the cusp of summer, while we bond together to crown Jamie a dentist. Don't let our friendships decay, or there may arise a cavity in your soul. Please remember to text me so I can let you incisor. Malocclusion.

                None of us have known a Mosesless Madison, and you may feel a pinprick of fear. What if he was holding off an otherworldy menace at great personal cost? Who's going to be Tom Waites? Who can I smoke weed with now? Find the answers to these questions and more at this very special Fun Club. Whether you've known him your entire life or it only feels that way, we'll all be left with gaping holes once Moses leaves on that jet plane. I wish we had a big blanket that we could all hold and he'd be in the middle and then we snap it tight and launch him into the air, over and over.

                There's nothing like biting into a sugar cookie with that bright, colorful icing on top. You feel your incisors glide through the soft, sweet gel until they bump into something a little denser. The cookie itself. With a little bit of force you wrest the yummy chunk from the cookie at large. You chew, blending the pastel paste into the beige meat of the cake. Wash it down with a swig of your favorite milk and feel all your cares fade away.

                Winnie lamented the fact that we missed Easter and wanted to make some cookies. Join us for that, and feel free to bring your favorite frostings or jimmies (that's sprinkles for us yanks). Just nobody bring those tiny, hard silver balls. They taste amazing but they're too hard to crunch and they will ruin the cookie.

                After we've crushed our respective drinks and drank with our respective crushes, rush back down to the safety and comfort of, well, my house. I still haven't played Sushi Go Party yet and it's tearing me apart, so I have to insist that it comes next. After that, who knows? Only Thor does. Because he's the chosen diety of Thursday Fun Club. Get it?

                    Have you ever had that gummy sushi? Or wait, they didn't make that, it was a gummy hamburger and fries. The fries were sour and coated in sugar. They also make a gummy pizza set. Sometimes I miss gummy things.

                   Springtime is quickly melting by, and the mind drifts to thoughts of ice cream. What's your favorite ice cream? Spumone? Huh, cool. Did you have an ice cream shop in your neighborhood when you were little? We had Frosty Freeze in Janesville and we loved it. I would order a hot-fudge shake and I felt cool because it was unconventional, and also because of the ice cream I was eating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'll provide some pints of vegan ice cream, and also feel free to bring your favorite flavor if you feel like it.

                   What comes to mind when you think of Fun Club? Truffle oil chips? Tumple? Gales of laughter? Cans of beer with colorful labels? Or is it the people? Or is it just one person? That would be weird if it were just one person. However, just one person is who we're celebrating this week, with Leona Day! Leona "Leo" Bergmann, bearer of smiles, bringer of mead, and even sweeter still. Damn that's poetic. Whether it's her fiercely competitive nature, unwavering eye contact, or her deep well of compassion and empathy, we all have something to love. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we're all just barely worthy of Peach, then it's just a sliver of a knifes edge of worthiness that brings Leona into our lives approximately once a week. Join us as we curse god above for only making one of her.

                We take care of our own, whether the creature is 1, 3, or 4 legged. Peach has a bent paw, so gather around her hospital bed and offer thrumming prayers with your fellow Thufuclubians. She'll get through this, and we'll emerge on the other side closer, kinder, stronger, and with straight paws all. Praise be to Bast and don't forget to bring your favorite catnip-infused prayer beads.

                When god invented cats, he didn't know it would be 2000 years until they reached their true potential. God is now dead, but Peach lives, and will have done so for one year as of March 7th. Jo and I don't deserve to have such a wonderful animal in our lives, but we come the closest and bear our wonderful burden with humility and purpose.
            </p>

                What do you get the cat who has everything? Just your smiling faces and petting hands, so come on over and celebrate with us.
